My repo is a bit confusing.

This is what I would do...

Create a directory off your home called "repo", clone my repo to it.   And then copy just the SabreCNC config,  so
  mkdir ~/repo
  cd ~/repo
  git clone git@github.com:SkyMoCo/LinuxCNCConfigs.git
  cd ~/repo/LinuxCNCConfigs/SabreCNC/configs
  cp -r SabreCNC ~/linuxcnc/configs
  cd ~/linuxcnc/configs/SabreCNC/
  linuxcnc SabreCNC.ini
